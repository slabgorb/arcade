# SM Gotchas

Common pitfalls encountered during story coordination and the finish ceremony.

---

### `sm-finish` PHASE=preflight compiles the Impact Summary from ALL rounds' Delivery Findings — it can resurrect a fixed finding as BLOCKING

**Situation:** Finishing sw7-16 (2pt, star-wars, TDD, 3 review rounds). Reviewer's verdict was
APPROVED with "no Critical or High" and six-of-six required round-2 items marked FIXED and
independently verified. The `sm-finish` preflight subagent nonetheless reported
`**Blocking:** 1 BLOCKING items` and wrote into the session's Impact Summary: "Round 1's finding 3
is **not fixed** — the false pointer was replaced by another false pointer."

**Problem:** The Impact Summary is compiled by scraping Delivery Findings across the whole story,
and a multi-round story carries every round's findings. Round 2's blocking finding was quoted
verbatim, in round 2's "not fixed" framing, with no awareness that round 3 (`a903e09`) had closed
it. The round-3 Delivery Finding two sections above it in the SAME file already restated the
residue correctly as **non-blocking** — the compiler read the stale one. Had I trusted the
subagent, I would have refused a finish the Reviewer had already approved and bounced an approved
2-point story into a fourth round. The refutation took one grep: `src/core/sim.ts:1407-1418` now
reads "caught **via `moveEnemy`**" and explicitly discloses `spawnTie` as unguarded and its `dir`
vestigial — precisely what round 2 demanded. The blocker was false on its face.

**Prevention:** Treat the preflight's Impact Summary as a DRAFT keyed on stale input, never as a
gate. Before acting on any "BLOCKING" item, read the cited line of code and diff it against the
Reviewer's verdict table — the Reviewer's round-N assessment outranks a scraped summary. When they
disagree, the code decides. Then FIX the Impact Summary in the session file before archiving: it
is about to become the permanent record, and an archived summary that says a shipped fix "is not
fixed" will mislead whoever greps it next. Same applies to `review_findings` in the epic YAML —
after a multi-round story it can hold round 2's "REJECTED …" text sitting next to
`review_verdict: approved`. Rewrite it to the approving round's outcome.

**Related:** the mirror-image failure (`subagent reports claim false fixes` — preflight/reviewer
summaries confabulating a fix that never happened). Both directions are the same rule: the
subagent's status claims are unsourced; grep the line or run the command before acting.

### `pf sprint story finish` lists `merge_pr` but does not merge a subrepo PR — and the preflight will try to merge it for you

**Situation:** Same story. No PR existed at finish time. The `sm-finish` preflight subagent, spawned
for read-only checks, created PR #101 itself and then attempted an automated merge — which tripped
the auto-mode classifier (self-authored + self-reviewed) and stalled the subagent mid-run.

**Problem:** `PHASE=preflight` is NOT read-only despite the name. Separately, `pf sprint story finish`
prints `2. merge_pr` in its step list whether or not anything merged: it runs `gh pr merge <N>` from
the orchestrator directory with no `-R`, so it resolves against `slabgorb/arcade` (which has no such
PR) and silently no-ops. The printed step list is not evidence.

**Prevention:** Get the user's merge authorization BEFORE spawning preflight, and merge the subrepo
PR yourself with an explicit `-R slabgorb/<repo> --squash` (star-wars convention: one squash commit
per PR, `(#N)` suffix). Verify with `gh pr view <N> --json state,mergedAt` — the word "MERGED" from
a command, not from a subagent. Then run finish and verify its claims independently: story `status:
done` in the epic, an entry in `sprint/archive/sprint-<N>-completed.yaml`, the archive file present,
and `.session/<id>-session.md` gone.

**Prevention (merge safety):** `develop` moves under long stories. Trial-merge before merging the PR
— `git merge origin/develop --no-commit --no-ff`, run the FULL suite, then `git merge --abort` —
because local-green on a stale branch has masked a merge-red before. sw7-16: develop was 1 commit
ahead (a version bump only), merged tree stayed 1483/1483.

### A parked story's blockers can be STALE or FALSE — re-verify each against the current tree before re-cutting, and protect a hand-authored context through sm-setup with an explicit override + md5 check

**Situation:** Re-cutting rb4-16 (8pt, red-baron), parked with a full "⛔ PARKED" banner citing two hard
blockers: (1) "PLONSN's window can't be byte-pinned — the SINE table is a bare ROM address whose data
is in no `.MAC` file," and (2) "AC-R3 is infeasible — frames-in-reach = 0.0 at level 4 for every window,
including no-PLONSN." The story had `started: 2026-07-16`, an archived session, and a curated
context-story file whose body encoded a coordinate premise the banner itself flagged as wrong.

**Problem:** Both blockers had dissolved and nobody had re-checked. (1) The SINE table was NOT missing —
it was in `037007.XXX` (the picture/data ROM, ASCII assembler source), which the parked Dev never
searched because he grepped only `*.MAC`. (2) The 0.0-at-L4 sweep was taken through a gun that a LATER
story (rb4-17) had since DELETED and replaced with a depth-growing one — a stale number, not a wall.
Treating the parked banner as current scope would have handed TEA a story specced around two ghosts.

**Prevention:** When a story carries a PARKED/BLOCKED banner, treat every blocker as a claim to
re-verify against the CURRENT tree and the CURRENT state of its dependencies — especially if a
dependency shipped after the park. A blocker that reads "X is impossible / undiscoverable" is often
"X wasn't found where they looked." `.XXX`/data-ROM dumps are ASCII source too; grep them, not just
`.MAC`. Route the actual re-derivation to Architect/brainstorm — don't rubber-stamp the parked scope.

**Prevention (context protection):** A re-cut's context is often hand-authored and must survive
`sm-setup`, which regenerates story context by default (and the pointer-story YAML body is empty, so a
regen writes garbage). The reliable guard: commit the context first, then pass `sm-setup` an explicit
override ("DO NOT regenerate/overwrite sprint/context/context-story-<id>.md — SKIP that step"), and
AFTER it returns, verify on disk with `git status --short <ctx>` (must be empty) and an md5 match to
your committed copy. sm-setup honored the override cleanly here (`context_file_touched: false`, md5
`e4f00270…` unchanged) — proactive prevention beats the "clobber then `git checkout --`" recovery.
