### To implement an authentic vector shape, pull geometry from historicalsource — `star-wars/reference/disasm/` doesn't have it

**Situation:** GREEN-phase implementation of an authentic 1983 vector *shape* (fireball, explosion, gunshot, object picture) in the star-wars game.

**Problem:** `reference/disasm/` is only the two-board 6809 disassembly. It shows the draw *routine* + a `JSRL`/`VR` picture *address* (e.g. fireball `sub_AC52` → `JSRL $A015`), but the AVG vector-picture ROM — the actual `AON/AOFF/FUSE` vertex deltas — is **not** there. Coding "to match the disasm" leaves you guessing the geometry.

**Prevention:** Get the exact geometry from the preserved Atari source: GitHub **`historicalsource/star-wars`** (commit `5355b76`, codename **"Warp Speed"**) → **`WSVROM.MAC`** = object pictures. Translate its `CXY`/`COLOR`/`AON dx,dy`(draw)/`AOFF dx,dy`(move)/`FUSE`(dot) directives into our TS render.

**Fix:** `curl -sSL raw.githubusercontent.com/historicalsource/star-wars/5355b76/WSVROM.MAC` → `tr '\r' '\n'` (CR-terminated non-UTF8) → `grep -a`. Match the picture label the disasm's `JSRL` targets; re-express as our own code (never copy verbatim — it's copyrighted, study-only).

**Example:** enemy fireball = `GNB0–3` (base sparkle, `COLOR VGCRED`, ~8 spikes from center `(0,0)` + `FUSE` balls, 4 flicker frames) + `GNT0–3` (small tip fuse-ball); `ASPECT` for round; distance-scaled. Red, spiky — NOT concentric amber rings. Writeup: `star-wars/docs/star-wars-1983-source-findings.md` ("Original Atari source").
