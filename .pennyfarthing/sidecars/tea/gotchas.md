# TEA Gotchas

Common pitfalls encountered during TEA (test-design / RED) work.

### Authentic vector SHAPE isn't in `star-wars/reference/disasm/` — get it from historicalsource

**Situation:** Writing a RED test that pins an *authentic 1983 vector shape* (fireball, explosion, an object's picture) for the star-wars game.

**Problem:** `reference/disasm/` is only a **disassembly of the two 6809 boards**. It gives you the draw *routine* and a `JSRL`/`VR` picture *address* (e.g. fireball `sub_AC52` → `JSRL $A015`) but **not the picture geometry** — the AVG vector-picture ROM is not in the quarry. If you stop there you'll block, or invent a shape and pin a fabricated spec.

**Prevention:** For any "what shape does the ROM draw" question, go straight to the preserved original Atari source: GitHub **`historicalsource/star-wars`** (commit `5355b76`), codename **"Warp Speed"** → **`WSVROM.MAC`** holds the object pictures. Then the RED test pins the *real* geometry.

**Fix:** Fetch raw from `raw.githubusercontent.com/historicalsource/star-wars/5355b76/WSVROM.MAC`; files are CR-terminated non-UTF8, so `tr '\r' '\n'` then `grep -a`. Cross-reference the picture label the disasm's `JSRL` points to.

**Example:** enemy fireball = `WSVROM.MAC` `GNB0–3`/`GNT0–3` under `.SBTTLE GUNSHOT PICTURES` — an animated **red radial sparkle** (`COLOR VGCRED`, ~8 spikes from center + `FUSE` balls, 4 frames), NOT the concentric amber rings our `drawFireball` had. Committable writeup: `star-wars/docs/star-wars-1983-source-findings.md` (intro, "Original Atari source").

### But game LOGIC (score tables, quotas, BCD bonuses, mission index) IS fully in the disasm — dig it there

**Situation:** RED test pinning an authentic *number/behavior* — a per-wave quota, a score/bonus value, a difficulty index — not a vector shape.

**Problem:** The historicalsource detour above is the wrong tool for logic; the commented `reference/disasm/StarWars_annotated.lst` already holds the data tables and the routines that consume them. Reaching for WSVROM.MAC here wastes a fetch.

**Prevention/Fix:** `grep -n` the symbol in `StarWars_annotated.lst`. Data is `fcb`/`fdb` tables; scores/bonuses are **packed BCD** (read digit-pairs literally: `fcb 5,0,0` = `05 00 00` = **50,000**; `fcb 0,2,0` = 200). Follow the consuming routine to learn the indexing: a table read is `ldb <index>; ldx #table; abx; lda ,x`, and the index often derives from a RAM mission counter (`byte_4B13 = min(byte_4B15-1, 31)`). Watch for a **PRNG re-roll / clamp** past the table end (`cmpx #end; bcs …; ldx #tail`) and for an **unused index-0 sentinel** (clone 1-based `wave` may map straight onto the table).

**Example (sw3-3):** surface towers-per-wave = `byte_98CB` (ROM:98CB) `[_,22,22,32,…,49,50]`, clamped to tail 50; the 50,000 "cleared all towers" bonus = `byte_9862` (BCD `05 00 00`), awarded in `sub_973A` when `byte_4B1A` (towers-left) hits 0. All recovered from the disasm alone — no historicalsource needed.

### Surface GROUND-OBJECT shapes aren't in WSVROM.MAC either — they're WSOBJ.MAC point tables + executable draw code

**Situation:** Pinning the authentic shape of a star-wars *surface ground object* (tower, bunker, stub, wall gun, exhaust port).

**Problem:** The earlier gotcha routes shape questions to `WSVROM.MAC` — correct for VG *pictures* (gunshots, banner, Death Star pics) but WRONG for ground objects: WSVROM has zero tower/bunker content. Grepping it wastes the fetch and suggests the shape is unrecoverable.

**Prevention/Fix:** Ground-object geometry lives in **`WSOBJ.MAC`** ("OBJECT TABLES AND VECTOR DRAW ROUTINES"): 3D point tables between `TPNT:`/`TPNTZ:` as `.WP <name>` macros (e.g. `.WP GND ;GROUND LASAR TOWER`, scale `.S=30.*4`, heights recentred by `GD$MDT=0xF00`). Connectivity for ground objects is NOT a line list — `.WGD <name>` entries are **executable 6809 draw code** (`PLOT/DRAWTO/BDRAWTO` over 1-based point indices; `BJGDRW` does `JMP (U)` into them). Aliases via `.WPZ2`/`.WGD2` mean several objects share one point table with different draw routines (TWR/BNK/STB all alias GND's 16 points). Placements per wave: `WSGRND.MAC` "TOWER MAZES" (TOWER/BISHOP/BUNKER macros — note BUNKER never increments `.TWRS`, so bunkers are tower-quota-neutral). Colors: WSGRND `GDVIEW` (`VGCYLW` body, `VGCWHT` hat, `VGCRED` lone bunker).

**Example (sw3-11):** authentic surface tower = `.WP GND` profile (h,r) = (0,8)(6,6)(14,5)(52,4)(58,4) — 58 tall × 16 wide, ~3.6:1 — with the white hat = the 52→58 cannon section, and the bunker = base+near-bottom rings only ("SHORTY"). Bonus trap: the local disasm's `Object_10` (which the clone had ported as SURFACE_TOWER) is *trench furniture* — its base rectangle is identical to `Obj_Trench_Squares`' outer square.

### A "renders inside-out / anomalous" bug on a vector model is NOT a winding/culling bug — the shell has neither

**Situation:** A story reports a model "renders inside-out / turned-through / anomalous" and asks you to fix the "winding/geometry" (e.g. sw3-10 Death Star). Your instinct (and even the SM handoff) may be "inverted normals / back-face culling."

**Problem:** These games are pure wireframes. `drawWireframe` (star-wars `src/shell/wireframe.ts`) strokes EVERY edge — no back-face cull, no hidden-line removal, no depth cue. There is no winding or normal to invert. Writing a RED test around "consistent winding / outward normals" pins a property the renderer doesn't use; it can't capture the real defect.

**Prevention/Fix:** REPRODUCE IT VISUALLY before theorising. The Chrome extension may be down — use the Playwright MCP against the running dev server (star-wars is already on `:5274`, base `/`). Two reliable moves: (1) `page.evaluate(async()=>{ const {DEATH_STAR}=await import('/src/core/models.ts'); ... })` and hand-project the vertices to a canvas at controlled angles; (2) better, drive the REAL frame: `import('/src/shell/render.ts').render(ctx, {...initialState(seed), phase:'space', phaseKills: SPACE_WAVE_QUOTA, enemies:[]}, W, H)` — that's exactly what the player sees. Screenshot to a file and Read it. Color-code the suspect sub-feature (e.g. dish edges red) to see how it reads. The real sw3-10 defect: the model is a fine UV sphere, but the superlaser dish was seated on **+X** while the space camera is IDENTITY at the origin looking −Z with the body at `[0,0,z<0]` (render.ts `deathStarPlacement`/`cameraView`), so the dish is seen EDGE-ON as a crossed bowtie spike. Fix = reseat the dish onto the camera-facing **+Z** hemisphere (pure geometry in `buildDeathStar`).

**Test design that survives:** recover the feature direction FROM GEOMETRY, don't pin indices. On a UV sphere ~all verts sit at radius R (11-7 on-shell contract); the dish's recessed floor is the lone vertex(es) at radius ≤ 0.9·R, so the unit centroid of the recessed set = the way the dish faces. Assert that axis has a dominant +Z (`axis[2] > 0.5`, `axis[2] > |axis[0]|`, `|axis[0]| < 0.5`). Also: 11-7 explicitly left "the VISUAL correctness of the superlaser dish" as an eyeball check it never did — orientation-left-to-eyeball is a recurring source of these follow-on bugs; when a builder's doc comment says "orientation is a RENDER concern to eyeball," expect a future fidelity story.

### Pin ANIMATION as topology-over-a-sweep, and stay seam-agnostic

**Situation:** RED test for a star-wars render *animation* (a multi-frame flicker, a cycling sparkle, a pulsing glow) where the frame-driver seam is left open by the SM handoff (shot `ttl` threaded in vs a shell-owned clock).

**Problem:** (1) Pinning the exact per-frame vertex data over-couples the test to one transcription and rejects valid faithful ports — and violates the repo's "colour-family + topology, not pixels" convention (sw3-9). (2) Driving the test off ONE seam (e.g. asserting "varying `ttl` changes the frame") forbids the other permitted seam; asserting "render is deterministic across identical calls" forbids a shell-clock seam.

**Prevention:** Assert the *observable topology CHANGES over a sweep*, seam-agnostically. Call the public `render(ctx, state, w, h)` across N samples that vary BOTH the shot state (`ttl`) AND the call count, collect a normalised per-frame signature (rounded stroke deltas relative to the projected centre), and assert `distinctSignatures ≥ 2`. That fails hard on a static frame (exactly 1) and passes under either driver. For "extra detail at tips" (fuse balls) count SHORT OFF-CENTRE marks (≤0.4× sparkle radius, both endpoints off the centre) so a split radial spike can't satisfy it.

**Fix:** Sample only the AGED shot life (`elapsed = TTL - ttl > muzzle window`) so no amber muzzle flash pollutes the red-body signature. Recommend (Delivery Finding, non-binding) the `elapsed`-driven seam — the exact quantity `render.ts` already uses for the muzzle flash — and warn OFF wall-clock drivers (non-deterministic, untestable). Leave "no `src/core` change" to the Reviewer's diff trace, not a unit test.

**Also:** when extending the recording-canvas mock to capture `fillStyle`/`arc` (needed to accept fuse balls drawn as filled dots), do NOT keep a plain `fillStyle: ''` property alongside a `get/set fillStyle` accessor — TS2300 "duplicate identifier". Use only the accessor (as the existing mock already does for `strokeStyle`). `tsc` catches it; vitest does not.

**Example (sw3-13, worked as sw3-11):** fireball flicker — 24-sample `ttl` sweep, `distinctSignatures ≥ 2` (static GNB0 = 1 → fails), plus ≥3 short off-centre fuse marks; guard asserts every frame stays a red centre sparkle, never amber.

### For star-wars GAME-LOGIC quarry, the ORIGINAL Atari source-text beats the disasm — real symbol names, whole routines

**Situation:** Pinning an authentic star-wars *behaviour/number* (a hit/miss test, a window, a timer, a score gate) — the "game LOGIC lives in the disasm" case, not a vector shape.

**Problem:** `reference/disasm/StarWars_annotated.lst` has the logic but under auto-generated names (`word_4845`, `DPbyte_92`, `sub_6B22`) that hide intent, and a routine's callers/callees are scattered. You can burn a lot of time reconstructing what a flag *means*.

**Prevention/Fix:** The full original "Warp Speed" source tree is at `/Users/slabgorb/Projects/star-wars-1983-source-text` (~120 `WS*.MAC` + `WSVROM.MAC` etc.) — the SAME repo family as `historicalsource/star-wars`, but the whole checkout. Game logic files: `WSMAIN.MAC` (phase/game loop), `WSBASE.MAC` (trench base motion, wedge layout), `WSGUNS.MAC` (player proton torpedo + collisions), `WSGAS.MAC` (scoring tables), `WSGRND.MAC` (ground objects). Symbols are HUMAN-named with intent comments. `grep -in "exhaust\|port\|miss\|800" WSMAIN.MAC`. Constants are octal/hex per file `.RADIX`; `#0800` etc. are hex.

**Example (sw3-15):** the exhaust-port hit/miss = `WSMAIN.MAC:1896-1917`: `LDD BS.ELC / SUBD M$TX / SUBD #0800 / IFLS ;?ABOUT TO BASH OUR NOSE IN THE END WALL?` — the `$800` window is ONE trench-wedge spacing (`WSBASE.MAC:1125` short wedge `#800`), a NARROW final segment. At the window, `LDA PT.LIV` (proton-torp-alive/on-target) decides HIT vs MISS; MISS → `PH$B0B` "TRY TRENCH AGAIN" (the clone's crash+respawn is authentic). The porthole `BS.PLC` is a FIXED location and the torpedo is GUIDED onto it (`WSGUNS.MAC MVPTGN`) — so "require aim alignment" does NOT mean randomise the port; keep it dead-centre and tighten the sphere.

### A story that changes a hit/collision CONTRACT breaks sibling tests staged OUTSIDE the new gate — re-seat them in RED

**Situation:** RED for a story that narrows/gates a collision or hit test (tighter radius, an approach window, an aim requirement) on a target other stories already have passing tests for.

**Problem:** Sibling suites often stage their hit at a *convenient* position that predates your gate (e.g. the port at trench-entry `-EXHAUST_PORT_DISTANCE`, or mid-trench `-1500`) and assert a HIT. Your new gate turns those green tests RED the moment Dev implements it — and Dev can't fix them (Dev makes tests pass, doesn't move goalposts). If you don't catch it in RED, Dev is stuck between your new AC and an old sibling test.

**Prevention/Fix:** BEFORE writing, `grep` every sibling test for the target and note the position each stages its hit at; anything outside your new gate must be re-seated (TEA owns test maintenance) into the gated region, preserving that test's ACTUAL intent (which is usually orthogonal to position). Verify the re-seat stays green BOTH on current code and after the fix (it should — you only moved it into a region both accept). Log each as a 6-field deviation. Your own new far-position test then supplies the "far shot is excluded" coverage the re-seat gave up.

**Example (sw3-15):** the `$800` window gate would have flipped `force-bonus.test.ts` (kill at `-2400`) and `exhaust-port-outcome.test.ts`'s real-speed detonation (`-1500`) to RED. Re-seated both to `-300` (in-window); the clean/dirty-bonus and no-tunnel intents are unchanged; the new suite's "torpedo fired at trench entry no longer wins" is the replacement far-miss coverage.
